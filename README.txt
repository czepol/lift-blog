Simple blogging app. 
I run my blog on it: http://acidbits.org/blog
See also demo: http://www.acidbits.org/lift-blog (might be older version)

Installation:
git clone git://github.com/kukems/lift-blog.git
cd lift-blog
mvn jetty:run

Now point your browser to: http://localhost:8080/login
During first deployment default user is created:
u: demo@demo.org
p: demo11

Have fun !

Lift-blog needs new design. If you would like to contribute one please contact me :)
